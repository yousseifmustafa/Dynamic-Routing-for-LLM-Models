<br>

This project is an **interactive web application** that intelligently classifies user queries and routes them to the most appropriate Large Language Model (LLM). Built with Streamlit and LangChain, it provides an efficient, scalable, and user-friendly interface to a powerful multi-model backend that optimizes for both cost and performance.

## 🚀 Core Features

-   **✨ Interactive Web UI**: A beautiful and responsive interface built with Streamlit, featuring a custom dark mode theme, one-click example prompts, and real-time feedback.
-   **🧠 Dynamic Routing**: Intelligently classifies queries into `Simple`, `Medium`, or `Advanced` to determine their complexity before execution.
-   **⚙️ Multi-Model Architecture**: Uses different Hugging Face LLMs for different tasks, optimizing for speed, cost, and analytical power.
-   **🛡️ Robust Fallback Mechanism**: If a chosen model fails, the system automatically retries the query with the next, more powerful model to ensure the user always gets a response.
-   **⚡ Response Caching**: Caches answers to previously seen queries to provide instant results and minimize redundant API calls.
-   **🔍 Transparent Logging**: The UI includes an expandable section to view the router's decision-making process and any errors encountered during execution.

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yousseifmustafa/Dynamic-Routing-for-LLM-Models.git](https://github.com/yousseifmustafa/Dynamic-Routing-for-LLM-Models.git)
cd Dynamic-Routing-for-LLM-Models
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
---
### 3. Install Dependencies
Create a `requirements.txt` file with the content below, then install all packages using pip.
```txt
# requirements.txt
streamlit
python-dotenv
langchain-huggingface
langchain_core
```
Now, run the installation command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your Hugging Face API token.
```
HF_API_KEY="your_hugging_face_api_key_here"
```
